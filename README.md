# Dashbord SI
A Proof-Of-Concept (POC) for a browser-based CPU load monitoring application.

You could have informations about:
- What is my computer's current average CPU load?
- How did the average CPU load change over a 10 minute window?
- Has my computer been under heavy CPU load for 2 minutes or more? When? How many times?
- Has my computer recovered from heavy CPU load? When? How many times?
